      subroutine smooth(prop)

      use common_block

      implicit none

! This subroutine smooths the variable "prop" (i.e. it adds the
! artificial viscosity) by taking (1-sf) * the calculated value of
! "prop" + sf * (the average of the surrounding values of "prop").
! where sf is the smoothing factor.
! It is modified if the deferred correction extension is adopted.

      real, dimension(i_max,j_max) ::  prop

! Local stuff
      real, dimension(i_max,j_max) ::  store
      real  ::  sf, sfm1, avg, avg1, avgnj
      integer  ::  i, j, ip1, im1

! To avoid using already smoothed values for smoothing other values
! the smoothed values are initially stored in an array "store".
! Wall nodes do not have 4 neighbours, so the formula for smoothing them
! is different.
! Inlet and exit values are constrained by boundary conditions and extrapolation from
! previously smoothed nodes, so how they are smoothed has little material effect
! on the solution.  Remember that they do not have 4 neighbours.

           avg = 0.25*(prop(ip1,j)+prop(im1,j)+prop(i,j-1)+prop(i,j+1))

           store(i,j) = sfm1*prop(i,j) + sf*avg
